## Project Goals

## Project deliverables and deadlines
* 5% Inspo: Find sources of inspiration that you think are cool, compile list
* 5% Idea spew: Create a list of 3+ project ideas you'd be interested in exploring - data and/or application and/or model have to be novel
* 10% I haz the data: Get the data and enough of it. Show off some examples.
* 20% Inkling: Run a baseline model on your data and get cracking!
* 20% Ignition on: Get a better SOTA (or your own) model running.
* 25% Invest in a risk: Let your creative juices take the reins for a bit and decide what to do for an experiment or two. It doesn't have to work, improve anything, etc. It probably won't, but you do it because it might and you're kind of curious.
* 15% Equal participation within your pair (N/A if flying solo): This to reduce the case where 1 person does all the work, and make it a bit easier on an individual.


## Project FAQs

### Is it okay to use a dataset that is not public?
Yes, but it's not encouraged. You will have to be able to describe it, and show generated data. 

### Can I share the CS236G project with another class's project?
Yes, we're OK with it -- as long as your other class is OK with it. Just make sure to specify that you are doing that, and we ask that you have the same student partners there and here.

### How many people can be on a team?
Max 2 people per team -- or feel free to do the project alone. A larger team size will be taken under consideration when evaluating the scope of the project in breadth and depth, meaning that a 2-person team is expected to accomplish more than a 1-person team would.

### Where can I find some project inspiration?
