## What is the grading breakdown?
Below is the breakdown of the class grade:
 * 50%: Final project - creativity and equal participation within a group will be rewarded
 * 25%: Midterm
 * 25%: Programming assignments & quizzes
 * 0%: Attendance
 * Extra credit: Your (or your GAN-generated) Memes. Requirements: Relevant and Appropriate with capital R and A there.

## What's up with lectures?
Lectures are Tuesdays & Thursdays 2:30-3:50PM PST over Zoom. Tuesdays will cover general material, and Thursdays will delve a bit deeper. Feel free to skip and post on Piazza if that's more your jam. 

## What are some ways I can do lecture, if I like learning that way?
You can watch the lectures live by going to Canvas, and going to the <a href="https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/117317/external_tools/5384">Zoom tab</a>. Recordings will also be posted after lecture onto Canvas.

## How is the final project graded?
The final project grade will incorporate the following components:
 * 5% Inspo: Find sources of inspiration that you think are cool, compile list
 * 5% Idea spew: Create a list of 3+ project ideas you'd be interested in exploring - data and/or application and/or model have to be novel
 * 10% I haz the data: Get the data and enough of it. Show off some examples.
 * 20% Inkling: Run a baseline model on your data and get cracking!
 * 20% Ignition on: Get a better SOTA (or your own) model running.
 * 25% Invest in a risk: Let your creative juices take the reins for a bit and decide what to do for an experiment or two. It doesn't have to work, improve anything, etc. It probably won't, but you do it because it might and you're kind of curious.
 * 15% Equal participation within your pair (N/A if flying solo): This to reduce the case where 1 person does all the work, and make it a bit easier on an individual.

Deadlines are listed in the project page and on the schedule page of the website.

## Is it okay to use a dataset that is not public?
Yes, but it's not encourage. You will have to be able to describe it, and show generated data. 

## Can I share the CS236G project with another class's project?
Yes, we're OK with it -- as long as your other class is OK with it. Just make sure to specify that you are doing that, and we ask that you have the same student partners there and here.

## How many people can be on a team?
Max 2 people per team -- or feel free to do the project alone. A larger team size will be taken under consideration when evaluating the scope of the project in breadth and depth, meaning that a 2-person team is expected to accomplish more than a 1-person team would.

## Where can I find some project inspiration?
[Awesome GAN](https://github.com/nightrome/really-awesome-gan)

## Is there a textbook or other resource I could use to supplement my learning?
Not officially, but great resources are Deep Generative Models (Ch. 20) in [The Deep Learning book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) and Deep Learning (Ch. 21) in [AI: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/).

## Can I audit CS230?
Yes! If you have a Stanford ID. You'll get access to some materials (but likely not all).
